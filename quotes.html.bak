				<ul>
					<li>He who knows me only through what I have published does not know me.</li><br>
					
					<li>The pleasure we obtain from music comes from counting, but counting unconsciously. Music is nothing but unconscious arithmetic.</li><br>
					
					<li>Although the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream and the physical world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this dream or phantasm real enough, if, using reason well, we were never deceived by it.</li><br>
					
					<li>If you could blow the brain up to the size of a mill and walk about inside, you would not find consciousness.</li><br>
					
					<li>If controversies were to arise, there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two calculators. For it would suffice for them to take their pencils in their hands and to sit down at the abacus, and say to each other (and if they so wish also to a friend called to help): Let us calculate.</li><br>
					
					<li>Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time when Newton lived, what he had done was much the better half.</li><br>
					
					<li>To love is to be delighted by the happiness of someone, or to experience pleasure upon the happiness of another.</li><br>
					
					<li>It is worth noting that the notation facilitates discovery. This, in a most wonderful way, reduces the mind&#x27;s labour.</li><br>
					
					<li>If we were magically shrunk and put into someone&#x27;s brain while she was thinking, we would see all the pumps, pistons, gears and levers working away and we would be able to describe the workings completely, in mechanical terms, thereby completely describing the thought processes of the brain. But that description would not contain any mention of thought! It would contain nothing but descriptions of pumps, pistons, levers!</li><br>
					
					<li>The words 'Here you can find perfect peace' can be written only over the gates of a cemetery.</li><br>
					
					<li>A great doctor kills more people than a great general.</li><br>
					
					<li>The Divine Spirit found a sublime outlet in that wonder of analysis, that portent of the ideal world, that amphibian between being and not-being, which we call the imaginary root of negative unity. </li><br>
					
					<li>Philosophy consists mostly of kicking up a lot of dust and then complaining that you can&#x27;t see anything.</li><br>
					
					<li>It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation which could be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.</li><br>
					
					<li>As far as we are capable of knowledge we sin in neglecting to acquire it.</li>
