				<p>The manuscripts of Leibniz have been continuously studied since his death.<p>

				<p>Kurt G&ouml;del theorized that Leibniz&#x27;s writings were suppressed &#x2D; and in fact after his death, 200,000 pages were confiscated from Leibniz&#x27;s personal library by George I to protect state secrets.</p>

				<p>Due to George&#x27;s fears, Leibniz&#x27;s writings have been well preserved and were unsealed long ago. However, the project to catalog the complete works of Leibniz began in 1923 and isn&#x27;t expected to be complete until 2048.</p>

				<p>He wrote in Latin and French but was also fluent in English, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew &#x2D; and even used some Russian and Chinese. He was a prolific letter writer and so far, researchers have counted 1100 correspondents from 16 countries (it is estimated that he logged over 20,000 km of world travel by horse&#x2D;drawn carriage&#x21;).</p>

				<p>Leibniz also scribbled notes on pieces of paper that he then threw into a large cupboard, he even described his own disorganization:
					<blockquote>Rather than hunt for it among a chaos of sheets that I never had time to sort out and index, I have to do the work all over again&#x21;</blockquote>

				<p>Though Leibniz never married, his letters have revealed that he was a favorite with women of the court and had higher than average standard of personal hygiene. Leibniz was known for his sweet aroma, long oversized wig, velvet lined carriage and frequent visits to spas. He was also fond of money and status, adding von to his signature in later life despite a lack of evidence he had been awarded the title&#x21;</p>
