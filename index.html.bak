					<h3>Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz has been described as the last universal genius and founder of the German enlightenment.</h3>
						<p>The great polymath made contributions to the fields of philosophy, mathematics, logic, mechanics, law, theology, politics, psychology, sociology, geology, history, genealogy, linguistics, natural philosophy, optics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, nautical science, jurisprudence, economics, philology, paleontology and founded topology. The contributions of Leibniz not only made a significant impact in the seventeenth century but continue to impact mathematics and computer science of the modern era.</p>

					<br><h4>Two years before the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War &#x2D; four years after Galileo&#x27;s death and Newton&#x27;s birth &#x2D; Leibniz was born in Leipzig on July 1, 1646.</h4>
						<p> His father Friedrich Leibniz was a professor of moral philosophy and mother Catharina Schmuck was the well&#x2D;educated daughter of a lawyer. At the age of six, Friedrich died, and the young Gottfried inherited his vast library. Leibniz had learned to read by the age of four, taught himself Latin by the age of eight, and discovered an interest in the formal study of logic by the age of thirteen. He studied law and philosophy at university and was offered a position as a professor at the age of twenty. Leibniz however sought a life of public affairs and politics and soon found himself in Paris.</p>

					<br><h4>Though he was sent to Paris on a diplomatic mission, Leibniz soon developed a deeper interest in mathematics and began to devote serious study to the field.</h4>
						<p>It was in this initial development of his mathematics study that Leibniz created his Instrumentum Artithmeticum, a mechanical calculating machine. His original model and demonstration gained Leibniz membership to the Royal Society of London in 1673. Leibniz interest in mechanical calculation led to his further development of binary calculation. Though a base two system had been used as early as 300 B.C. by the Indian author Pingala, Leibniz investigated the use of binary as an easier method of mechanical computing.</p>

					<br><h4>Leibniz interest in binary ranged from the still clearly logical to the metaphysical inquiries of the 17th century.</h4>
						<p>Described as the most important mind in logic since Aristotle and until Boole, he also dedicated his life to the development of symbolic logic and creation of a &quot;universal language&quot;. Leibniz sought to create an algebra of human thought so that,
							<blockquote>Every misunderstanding should be nothing more than a miscalculation&#x85; easily corrected by the grammatical laws of that new language. Thus in the case of a controversial discussion, two philosophers could sit down at a table and just calculating, like two mathematicians, they could say, &#x27;Let us calculate&#x27;.</blockquote></p>

					<br><h4>By 1690, Leibniz had distilled most of the ideas covered in modern calculus textbooks and we still use the notation style that Leibniz devised.</h4>
						<p>Leibniz may be best known for his contributions to Calculus. However, an English scientist, Sir Isaac Newton, claimed to have invented calculus before Leibniz. While modern historians have concluded that both men independently arrived at their treatise, a great debate over the claim of invention turned to accusations from both sides of plagiarism. Ultimately, Leibniz requested an inquiry from the Royal society. They formally investigated the allegations, but without allowing any testimony from Leibniz took Newton&#x27;s side. The judgement was written by the Society&#x27;s president at the time&#x85; Sir Isaac Newton. The incident only grew in proportion over time. Leibniz&#x27;s political career was stifled by potential for negative reception from the English, and Newton&#x27;s unwillingness to publish Leibniz&#x27;s more practical notation cost English mathematicians nearly a century of isolation.</p> 

					<br><h4>Leibniz died on November 14, 1716.</h4>
						<p>The end of his life was marked by disease and controversy, his secretary Eckhart was the only person to attend his funeral. An eyewitness reported,
							<blockquote>He was buried more like a robber than what he really was, the ornament of his country.</blockquote>
						In 1790 a marker was added to the unmarked and neglected grave reading simply &quot;Ossa Leibnitii&quot; &#x2D; the bones of Leibniz.</p>
